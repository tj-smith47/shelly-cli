## shelly provision ble

BLE-based provisioning (not yet implemented)

### Synopsis

Provision a device using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

This command is intended for provisioning devices in AP mode that are not yet
connected to your network. BLE provisioning requires Bluetooth hardware support.

NOTE: This feature is not yet implemented. For now, connect to the device's AP
network and use 'shelly provision wifi' with the device's AP IP address (usually
192.168.33.1).

```
shelly provision ble <device-address> [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # BLE provisioning (future)
  shelly provision ble ShellyPlus1-ABCD1234

  # Current workaround: connect to device AP and use wifi provisioning
  # 1. Connect your computer to "ShellyPlus1-ABCD1234" WiFi network
  # 2. Run: shelly provision wifi 192.168.33.1
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for ble
```
