## shelly fleet

Cloud-based fleet management

### Synopsis

Manage devices through Shelly Cloud using the integrator API.

Fleet commands use WebSocket connections to the Shelly Cloud for
real-time device monitoring and control across your entire fleet.

Configuration:
  Set SHELLY_INTEGRATOR_TAG and SHELLY_INTEGRATOR_TOKEN environment variables,
  or configure them in the config file.

Note: This differs from local batch commands. Fleet operations go through
the cloud, while batch commands communicate directly with devices on your LAN.

### Examples

```
  # Connect to cloud hosts
  shelly fleet connect

  # View fleet status
  shelly fleet status

  # View fleet statistics
  shelly fleet stats

  # Check device health
  shelly fleet health

  # Control devices via cloud
  shelly fleet on --group living-room
  shelly fleet off --all
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for fleet
```
