.SH NAME
shelly-fleet - Cloud-based fleet management


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBshelly fleet [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Manage devices through Shelly Cloud using the integrator API.

.PP
Fleet commands use WebSocket connections to the Shelly Cloud for
real-time device monitoring and control across your entire fleet.

.PP
Configuration:
  Set SHELLY_INTEGRATOR_TAG and SHELLY_INTEGRATOR_TOKEN environment variables,
  or configure them in the config file.

.PP
Note: This differs from local batch commands. Fleet operations go through
the cloud, while batch commands communicate directly with devices on your LAN.
