Create a checklist formatted comprehensive plan for future sessions to generate an open source Cobra CLI project (repo: shelly-cli; command: shelly) using Go 1.25.5 (Released Decemer 4th, look it up, DO NOT downgrade Go) that encompasses the full Shelly API and all functionality in /db/appdata/shelly-go.

- It should be an extremely easy to use, intuitive, extensible, and customizable CLI loaded with convenience commands that simplify complex operations / commands / management tasks.
- It should enable to you do things you just cannot do with the Shelly API / APP, or at least, simplify multi-step operations / processesi that would be tedious to do without this CLI. It should have TUI dashboards (`shelly dash`) using projects like k9s and gh-dash as inspiration, and be able to render things you can see in the Shelly app.
- It should have convenience features like the alias command from gh for aliasing a commands / devices in your config file (managed by Viper), as well as auto-completions and an upgrade command.
- It should support plugins like gh does, if appropriate.
- It should have full theme support using lrstanley/bubbletint.
- It should have all the components of a great open source Go project - full godoc and user documentation, examples, a goreleaser setup and auto-tag-and-release workflows (see /db/appdata/gothememe for github actions workflows), and 90%+ test coverage.
- It should not be missing any features from https://github.com/ginsys/shelly-manager unless not appropriate, as that project is quite difference - but anything that applies, plus anything you come up with I'd like added.
- All future session work should be derived from the PLAN.md file you generate - no additional session files, etc. should ever be made, just checking off work and adding concise context if necessary that can't be derived from reading the repo (only if the knowledge will likely save investigation time for future sessions without bloating context).
- It is NEVER OK to determine tasks "optional", "nice to have", "not necessary", or a "future improvement" - put this at the top of the plan, and do not skimp due to context, the work can be split up if needed in order to preserve quality. Do not EVER defer work without reporting the reason you want to defer it to me and asking for my approval.
- It is critical that the codebase is concise / D.R.Y., well organized, and has high code quality using all modern features of Go as of 1.25.5 (e.g., sync.WaitGroup.Go(), GreenTea Garbage Collector, range over fun, etc.) with a strict golangci-lint adhering to all gocritic complaints.

The completed plan should be placed at /db/appdata/shelly-cli/PLAN.md.
